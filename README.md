# HW1
## Devlog
1. Allen (legal name: Bintao) Gu, he/him
2. The break-down activity destructs the whole game system into multple functions and destructs the functions into elements (game objects, code mudules, etc.). It makes the structure of the game clear so that I can work on different part respectively efficiently. It was like dividing the final goal into small goals. For example, the break-down divides the Update() method into two modules for two features respectively: the if() statement for moving and the if() statement for creating the prefab. I forgot a lot of things throughout the whole winter holiday and this activity really helps me memorizing some of them.
